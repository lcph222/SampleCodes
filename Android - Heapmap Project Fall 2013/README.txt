Abstract: 
	The Android Heatmap project is an android library to be used by android developers 
	to gather information about how their app is being used by customers.The way our 
	library helps these developers is by storing user touch points in a web front-end 
	where they will have a selection of things they can do with the data.  
	Such as getting the touch points for replaying, organizing the data and displaying 
	a heat map view of the touch points providing them a visual aid for analyzing the data.


These are the files with the codes we wrote. We did not include all the code, just the code we wrote.  

Here is the order the code is used:

MainACtivity -> Record -> drawView -> ServerAPI -> APIDelegate
